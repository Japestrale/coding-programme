## Digital Jersey Coding Programme

This repository contains all of the resources, slides, assets and guides for the programme.

## How to use this repo

Each session has its own folder. If there are assets or external resources for the session this is
where they can be found.

There are also some additional directories that do not match up to a specific sessions. Students will
hopefully find these useful when choosing a text editor or debugging.
