## Digital Jersey Coding Programme

This repository contains a brief overview of each session run on the course along with links to relevant resources and completed code written by mentors during sessions.  If you're lucky you might find that some of the code has comments.

##### 1 - Introduction to software and the course

##### 2 - Intoduction to HTML and CSS.

##### 3 - Taking the design of a simple dashboard page designed by Tom H and coding it up in HTML and CSS

You can find my completed code in the 'Session 2' Folder.  Remember that the way i've done it is not necessarily going to be the right way, as there are many different ways to get to the same end result (something that looks the same).

##### 4 - Wrapping up HTML & CSS basics

Coding up another design
* You can find the design in Session 4.
* For the gallery, don't worry about using the images on the design. Instead, use a service such as [PlaceKitten](https://placekitten.com/) which will provide you with lovely placeholder images of kittens.
* For the icons, don't use images.  Instead use an icon font such as [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/).   To use it just include a link to it in the head of your page (BootstrapCDN by MaxCDN method). Find out how to use the icons from the examples page.
* For the font, try using [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) - Perhaps try using a font such as Lato.

##### 6 - Setting up a ruby development environment

* Windows: You'll have Robs fancy Ubuntu virtual machine installed on your PC
* Mac: We lead you through [this guide](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html)
