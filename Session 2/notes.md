## Things to think about

- What screen size are we designing this for? Whats the target audience?
- Does this have to be responsive? (almost certainly yes). Try to use widths as percentages. Define wrappers with fixed widths if necessary and then change their width with media queries (more on this later).
- Do we need to worry about users using touch? This might affect sizing of elements that we want them to click.
- Are we working from a design? If so, pay attention to detail. Designers may have put a lot of work into getting things just right.

## Starting coding up

- Everything is a box. Everything. (Discuss box model, margin, padding and borders)

- My preference is to code up most HTML first, then do basic styles for layout before concentrating on specific sections.
